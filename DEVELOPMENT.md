### How to get set up for Monkey Development

There are a couple modules to monkey.  First, when cloned the included modules are *Monkey-Core*, *Monkey-Cli*, and Monkey-Web.  The Monkey-Client is initialized as a subrepo hosted in a public location so that all machines can pull it.  To pull subrepos:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive

```
